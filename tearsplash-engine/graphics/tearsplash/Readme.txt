Welcome to the Tearsplash engine!

This is a homemade 2D engine suitable for making sprite-based small games.

Build instructions:
To build the engine you need Visual Studio. I've tested compiling with 2015, 2017 and 2019, and it works for all those editions.

The engine can either be built in two ways.

1) Using Visual Studio directly.
 - Open the graphics.sln solution file and build the tearsplash project.
 - The static library built can now be used for another project.

2) Using CMake.
 - Download CMake and configure in the root level directory.
 - Open the generated Visual Studio solution and build the solution.
 - The static library built can now be used for another project.
