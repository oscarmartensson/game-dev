This is my following of the "Ray tracing in one weekend" tutorial made by Peter Shirley. I have made some minor adjustments and tweaks,
but the tutorial can be found here: http://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing%20in%20a%20Weekend.pdf,
and the source code of the tutorial can be found here: https://github.com/petershirley/raytracinginoneweekend

This project can be downloaded and compiled in Visual Studio 2017. To run the code, simply hit F5 in either Debug or Release mode.
The rendered scene can be seen in a file called "scene.ppm" and will be located in the output folder.
