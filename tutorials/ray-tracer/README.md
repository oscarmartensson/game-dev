This is my following of the "Ray tracing in one weekend" tutorial made by Peter Shirley. I have made some minor adjustments and tweaks,
but the tutorial can be found here: http://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing%20in%20a%20Weekend.pdf,
and the source code of the tutorial can be found here: https://github.com/petershirley/raytracinginoneweekend

This project can be downloaded and compiled in Visual Studio 2017. To run the code, open the ray-tracer.sln Visual Studio solution file and simply hit F5 for Debug or Release mode to build.
Both x64 and x86 has been tested to work. The rendered scene can be seen in a file called "scene.ppm" and will be located in the output folder.

Note! This has only been tested for Windows 10, but should work on other operating systems as well provided that you have Visual Studio 2017.
