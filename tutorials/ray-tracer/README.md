This is my own following of the "Ray tracing in one weekend" tutorial made by Peter Shirley. I have made some minor adjustments and tweaks,
but the tutorial can be found here: http://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing%20in%20a%20Weekend.pdf,
and the source code of the tutorial can be found here: https://github.com/petershirley/raytracinginoneweekend
